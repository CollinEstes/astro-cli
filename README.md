# Astro - the space age developer's best friend

## a docker based code style checker, tester, transpiler, transformer, and more.

Astro is a command line tool for developers to quickly perform the common tasks that make up a modern workflow.

Astro is under active development. Working currently on docker implmentation and npm workflow with astro modules.

Astro is currently not ready to use, but I am targeting end of June for 1.0 release.
