# Astro
	the space age developer's best friend

## a javascript style checker, tester, transpiler, transformer, and more.

Astro is a command line tool for developers to quickly perform the common tasks that make up a modern workflow or asset pipeline, but doing so from external to the application itself.

Astro aims to eliminate setup time needed when creating or enhancing micro-service modules. Astro provides a framework for incorporating the latest workflow tooling and processes into daily software engineering workflows.  Astro does not require any configuration to be used out of the box. As workflow tooling and processes change, existing applications will require no task runner updates, no new scripts, and no additional dependencies to use the latest tools.


Currently Astro provides Node.js and front-end development workflow tools:

	+ Style / Syntax Checking
		+ Jshint
		+ JSCS (coming soon)
		+ ESLINT (coming soon)
	+ Testing
		+ Mocha (with chai, sinon and sinon-chai)
	+ Transpiling
		+ Babel (coming soon)
		+ SASS (coming soon)
	+ Transforming
		+ Concat / Minification (coming soon)
		+ Image compression (coming soon)
	+ Building
		+ Docker (coming soon)
